# Pros & Cons of Swerve + Mecanum Comparison

## Pros -

* Swerve allows for great maneuverability, allowing for omnidirectional movement. This is done without the need for "crab walking," as is the case with Mec. When we line up to score, this will be easier under Swerve.

* As we saw w/ several of the teams at the last competition, especially Team 870, the wheels that can be used in Swerve have greater traction when compared to the wheels used on a Mecanum-style drivetrain. While this isn't always going to be an end-all-be-all, this is an important factor in objectives such as this year's Charging Station, and may make driver training easier when practicing on lower-friction surfaces. 

* Per point one, Swerve makes it harder for opposing teams to pin a robot operating under the aforementioned drive.

* From the teams we spoke with, it would appear that driving a robot under Swerve is relatively easy, with not a lot of breaking during the competition.

* Any side of the robot could be treated as its "front" at any given time.

* Can produce a greater pushing force.

* Modular; can be replaced when things break, but mods are quite expensive.

## Cons -

* Although failure was rare at the last competition, with how many moving components there are, there are many potential points of failure. 

* With the above in mind, Swerve modules are *very* heavy; each module alone requires two motors, requiring a lot of upkeep and resources.

* Software development for the drivetrain can be more complex than what would be needed with Mecanum. However, many of the teams at competition used a publicly available API that made programming more straightforward. With this, Andy has noted that he would like to steer clear of them initially, and have a more intimate understanding of the underlying software principles involved.

* With all of this in mind, committing to Swerve will be very time consuming, and will require a lot of dedication.

# What is Swerve Drive?

Swerve drive uses traditional wheels operated by two motors per module independently to produce non-holonomic motion. One motor controls wheel rolling, while the other controls rotation when turning.

# What is Mecanum?

Holonomic drivetrain operated by using Mecanum wheels that allow for the robot to have omnidirectional movement without needing the robot to turn. The Mecanum wheels are designed with rollers that permit such motion.
